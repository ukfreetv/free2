# free2 - Welcome to the sample code 

Most of the things you want to see are in the free2/registrationDemo folder.

The database connection config is in free2/siteconfig.php


# Notes

- This isn't a complete version of what was asked for, but what was doable in a couple of hours.

- The start route is http://localhost:5678/demo/demo

- The system doesn't use postcodes.io, but a demo version of the full PAF.  The docs for that are at
  https://www.poweredbypaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Latest-Programmers_guide_Edition-7-Version-6.pdf
  
- The demo data supports only "YO" and "PL" postcodes, so YO14 0NE works, for example.   

- The code in the pseph/nff folders is a lightweight framework ("no framework, framework") of my own devising.
